# Venta eCommerce Framework

<hr/>

Our mission is to create an open-source eCommerce framework that developers will
love to use. As simple as that. We will achieve it by building simple, intuitive,
well thought and documented codebase. Codebase that will be a result of continuous
improvements and changes based on developer community feedback, suggestions, ideas.

Code quality, readability and simplicity will be our means of encouragement for the
developers to choose this framework over others. Modern stack, carefully selected
packages and tools that are widely accepted and beloved by community will result in
fast, stable and easy-to-learn framework. Framework that is truly built for developers.

We do not plan to compete with other “all-inclusive” eCommerce platforms and content
management systems. Instead, we will concentrate on building an easily customizable
and modular framework that can be quickly extended to match any unique requirements.
A base for quick and easy ERP, CRM, POS and other 3RD party service integrations,
plug-and-play modules system, data import and export tools, and many more. All in
all — a framework designed to be customised.

This will not be yet another eCommerce framework tagged with “next generation” or
“best in class” labels. It’ll be an experience, hard work, dedication, community
feedback and passion mixed into one. ou, developer, be the judge of outcome.
