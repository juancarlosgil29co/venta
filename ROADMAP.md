This is more like high level road map - steps will be split to minor ones, as soon as we get till that point.

Item | Description | Status
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Finish PSR-7 implementation | Basically, it is Request, Response and Routing implementation | In progress
Console application | Create base for console applications, so it is possible to define commands already | TBD
Minor packages development | This includes developing and including into application low-level stuff like Events, Logging etc. packages | TBD
More complex packages development | This step should include developing more high level packages development, still particularly unrelated to eCommerce itself - configuration, auth, db and etc. stuff should be done here | TBD
eCommerce related packages implementation | As title stands | TBD
